Ashwin's Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Grapher
===================================

This sample is the initial prototype of a health app that connects to an ECG patch with Bluetooth LE capabilities
Please enable location services on your phone in order to access the scanning of nearby Bluetooth LE devices

Introduction
------------

This Bluetooth LE application shows a list of available Bluetooth LE devices and provides
an interface to connect, read, and graph characteristics supported by the devices.

It creates a [Service][1] for managing connection and data communication with a GATT server
hosted on a given Bluetooth LE device.

The Activities communicate with the Service, which in turn interacts with the [Bluetooth LE API][2].
